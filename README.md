### Introduction to CS Research (Northeastern University, Prof. Rose Yu)

Problem: Companies collect and find patterns to power algorithms that provide personalized experiences and share data with third parties. Data anonymity is not guaranteed and private information can still be exploited.

Homomorphic Encryption is an encryption scheme that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without compromising on features or security, protecting users from exploitation.

Purpose: To use sample Facebook datasets to conduct an experiment on the validity of homomorphic encryption.
